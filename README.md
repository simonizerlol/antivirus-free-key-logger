# antivirus-free-key-logger
a simple python script that uses [pyHook] (# http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyhook/files/pyhook/1.5.1/) to grab the mouse and keyboard events in Windows and [pyWin32] (# http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/Build%20219/) to pumped the messages out.

Note that the script has to be manually terminated else it will keep on running in the background.
